# Ourchive Themes

This repo holds themes used in [ourchive](https://github.com/c-e-p/). 

We follow UIKit's [documentation](https://getuikit.com/docs/sass) for creating & modifying a theme using Sass. The assumption is that you will have a subdirectory, within this repo, containing the UIKit source from Git.

Compiled CSS is then added to the project by the developer.
